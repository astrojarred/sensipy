## Overview

The gravitational wave toy is a tool for simulating gravitational wave follow-up observations with gamma-ray observatories.

## Features

This package has three main features:

- calculating the differential or integral sensitivity of a partiuclar observatory given a spectral model
- simulating the time needed to observe a source with a particular model to reach a given significance
- using pre-computed observation times to quickly calculate exposure times for observing a source with a particular model

In all cases, the code needs a time-resolved spectral model and instrument response functions (IRFs) for a given instrument
