## What is sensipy?

**sensipy** is a Python package for simulating very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray follow-up observations of gravitational wave (GW) events. It is specifically designed to work with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) and builds on top of [Gammapy](https://gammapy.org/), the open-source Python package for gamma-ray astronomy.

The package enables researchers to determine under which circumstances electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events could be detectable by gamma-ray observatories, particularly in the TeV energy range.

## Scientific Background

The detection of gravitational waves has opened a new window to the universe. When compact objects like neutron stars or black holes merge, they can produce both gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation across multiple wavelengths. **sensipy** helps answer the question: _Can we detect the very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from these events?_

The package simulates how quickly a gamma-ray observatory like CTA could detect a transient source given:

- A time-evolving spectral energy distribution (SED)
- Instrument response functions (IRFs) for specific observing conditions
- Realistic observational constraints (delays, exposure times, sensitivity limits)

## Key Components

The package requires the following inputs:

- **Time-resolved spectral models**: Spectra that evolve over time, representing the source emission (e.g., gamma-ray burst models)
- **Instrument Response Functions (IRFs)**: CTAO IRFs that define the telescope's sensitivity under specific observing conditions
- **Observational parameters**: Energy range, observation delays, target significance levels, and other constraints

## Workflow

A typical workflow with sensipy involves:

1. **Loading IRFs** for your target observatory and observing conditions
2. **Preparing a spectral model** of the transient source (CSV or FITS format)
3. **Calculating sensitivity curves** using Gammapy or pre-computed templates
4. **Simulating observations** to determine detection times and required exposures
5. **Analyzing results** to understand detectability under different scenarios

## Use Cases

sensipy is particularly useful for:

- **Mission planning**: Determining optimal observing strategies for GW followup campaigns
- **Sensitivity studies**: Understanding detection prospects for different source models and observing conditions
- **Heatmap generation**: Creating visualizations showing detection fractions across parameter space
- **Quick lookups**: Using pre-computed databases to rapidly assess detectability during GW alerts
