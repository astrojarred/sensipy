## What is sensipy?

**sensipy** is a Python toolkit for simulating gamma-ray follow-up observations of time-variable astrophysical sources. It is specifically designed to work with many different instruments and builds on top of [gammapy](https://gammapy.org/), the open-source Python package for gamma-ray astronomy.

## Scientific Background

Many of the most exciting astrophysical phenomena are transient—gamma-ray bursts, flaring active galactic nuclei, novae, and electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events all evolve on timescales from seconds to days. **sensipy** helps answer a fundamental question: _Given a source that changes with time, can we detect it with a gamma-ray telescope?_

The package helps to simulate how quickly a gamma-ray telescope can detect a time-variable source given the following inputs:

- A time-evolving spectral energy distribution (SED)
- Instrument response functions (IRFs) for specific observing conditions
- Realistic observational constraints (delays, exposure times, sensitivity limits)

<Aside type="note">
  Among other things, this package enables researchers to determine under which circumstances electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events could be detectable by gamma-ray observatories, particularly in the TeV energy range. For more information about the original science motivation behind `sensipy`, check out the [ICRC 2023
  proceedings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07413).

## Key Components

The package requires the following inputs:

- **Time-resolved spectral models**: Spectra that evolve over time, representing the source emission (e.g., gamma-ray burst models)
- **Instrument Response Functions (IRFs)**: CTAO IRFs that define the telescope's sensitivity under specific observing conditions
- **Observational parameters**: Energy range, observation delays, target significance levels, and other constraints

## Workflow

A typical workflow with sensipy involves:

1. **Loading IRFs** for your target observatory and observing conditions
2. **Preparing a spectral model** of the transient source (CSV or FITS format)
3. **Calculating sensitivity curves** using Gammapy or pre-computed templates
4. **Simulating observations** to determine detection times and required exposures
5. **Analyzing results** to understand detectability under different scenarios

## Use Cases

sensipy is particularly useful for:

- **Mission planning**: Determining optimal observing strategies for gamma-ray followup campaigns
- **Sensitivity studies**: Understanding detection prospects for different source models and observing conditions
- **Heatmap generation**: Creating visualizations showing detection fractions across your parameter space
- **Quick lookups**: Using pre-computed lookup tables to rapidly assess detectability during transient alerts
