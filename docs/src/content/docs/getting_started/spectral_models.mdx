## Spectral Models

sensipy supports time-resolved spectral models. 
The data should contain spectra at varying times (or lightcurves at varying energies, depending on how you prefer to think about it).

Currently, the supported file formats are:

- CSV files
- FITS files

    <p>
        CSV files are the current recommended format for sensipy spectral models due to their flexibility and ease of use.

### CSV files format
The code expects a CSV file with three columns: time, energy, and flux (dNdE) with the following units:

- time: seconds
- energy: GeV
- dNdE: 1 / (cm2 s GeV)

Multiple spectra can be included in the same file, each with a different time. The code will automatically organize the data into a time-energy grid.

#### Sample CSV file
A full sample CSV file is available in the `data/mock_data` directory. The first rows look something like this:

```csv
time [s],energy [GeV],dNdE [cm-2 s-1 GeV-1]
1.061,1.04823,1e-08
1.061,1.14937,8.3179e-09
1.061,1.26026,6.9185e-09
1.061,1.38184,5.7547e-09
1.061,1.51516,4.7861e-09
...
```
