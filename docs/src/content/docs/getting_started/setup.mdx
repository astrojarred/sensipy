import {Aside} from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

After installing sensipy, you'll need to set up the required data files to use the package effectively.

**Setup checklist:**

- [ ] **Compatible IRFs** — CTAO IRFs are freely available on Zenodo *(required)*
- [x] **EBL models** — Included with package *(no action needed unless you want to use a different EBL model)*
- [x] **Spectral models** — Example data included *(bring your own for real analysis)*

## Quick Setup

### IRFs

Download CTAO IRFs automatically:

```bash 
uv run sensipy-download-ctao-irfs
```

or in an already activated conda environment:

```bash
sensipy-download-ctao-irfs
```

This downloads IRFs to `./IRFs/CTAO`. See the [IRFs](/getting_started/irfs) page for manual download instructions and details.

<Aside type="caution">
  The current recommendation by CTAO is **prod5-v0.1**, which **should be cited from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/5499840)**.
</Aside>


### EBL Models

EBL models are included with the package. No setup required unless you want to use Gammapy's EBL dataset. See the [EBL Models](/getting_started/ebl_models) page for details.

### Spectral Models

Example mock data is included with the package. See the [Spectral Models](/getting_started/spectral_models) page for format requirements and how to access the included mock data files.

## Verifying Your Setup

To verify your setup is working correctly:

```python
from sensipy.ctaoirf import IRFHouse
from sensipy.source import Source
import astropy.units as u

# Test IRF loading
print("Testing IRF loading...")
try:
    house = IRFHouse(base_directory="./IRFs/CTAO")
    irf = house.get_irf(
        site="south",
        configuration="alpha",
        zenith=20,
        duration=1800,
        azimuth="average",
        version="prod5-v0.1",
    )
    print("✓ IRF loading successful")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"✗ IRF loading failed: {e}")

# Test spectral model loading
print("Testing spectral model loading with EBL...")
try:
    from sensipy.util import get_data_path
    mock_data_path = get_data_path("mock_data/GRB_42_mock.csv")
    source = Source(
        filepath=str(mock_data_path),
        min_energy=30 * u.GeV,
        max_energy=10 * u.TeV,
        ebl="franceschini",
    )
    print("✓ Spectral model loading successful")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"✗ Spectral model loading failed: {e}")
```

## Next Steps

Now that your environment is set up, you can:

- Learn about [IRFs](/getting_started/irfs) setup and downloading
- Understand [EBL Models](/getting_started/ebl_models) and when to use them
- Learn about [Spectral Models](/getting_started/spectral_models) formats and requirements
- Follow the [Tutorials](/tutorials/) for step-by-step guides
- Explore the [API Reference](/reference/) for detailed documentation
