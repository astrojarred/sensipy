## Installation options

Our package is available on PyPI and can be installed using various methods.

<Aside>
    <p>
        Python 3.11+ is required for installation.

### Installing with `uv` (recommended)

`uv` is a tool for managing Python projects and dependencies. It is a modern alternative to `pip` and `venv`, and is lighter and faster than `conda`. For more information, see the [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

#### Adding to an existing `uv` project

```bash
uv add sensipy
```

#### Create a new `uv` project

Ininitalize a new project with Python 3.12 (for example), then add the sensipy to the project.

```bash
uv init -p 3.12
uv add sensipy
```

#### Updating the package with `uv`

Update the package to the latest version:

```bash
uv add -U sensipy
```

### Installing with `pip`

The sensipy can be installed into any existing Python environment using pip:

```bash
pip install sensipy
```

### Installing with `conda`

The sensipy can be installed into any existing conda environment using conda.

1. Make sure `pip` is installed in the environment.
2. Install the sensipy using pip.

```bash
conda activate my-environment
conda install pip
pip install sensipy
```

## Verifying the installation

To verify that sensipy is installed correctly, you can run:

```bash
python -c "import sensipy; print(sensipy.__version__)"
```

## Running the test suite

<Aside type="note">
    Running tests requires cloning the repository, as the test files are not included in the PyPI package.
</Aside>

If you've cloned the repository for development, you can run the test suite with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/astrojarred/sensipy.git
cd sensipy
uv run pytest
```

Or in a conda environment or a virtual environment with the development dependencies installed:

```bash
pytest
```
