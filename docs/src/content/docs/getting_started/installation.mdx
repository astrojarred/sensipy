### Installing with `uv` (recommended)

`uv` is a tool for managing Python projects and dependencies. It is a modern alternative to `pip` and `venv`, and is lighter and faster than `conda`. For more information, see the [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

#### Adding to an existing `uv` project

```bash
uv add sensipy
```

#### Create a new `uv` project

Ininitalize a new project with Python 3.12 (for example), then add the sensipy to the project.

```bash
uv init -p 3.12
uv add sensipy
```

#### Updating the package with `uv`

Update the package to the latest version:

```bash
uv add -U sensipy
```

### Installing with `pip`

The sensipy can be installed into any existing Python environment using pip:

```bash
pip install sensipy
```

### Installing with `conda`

The sensipy can be installed into any existing conda environment using conda.

1. Make sure `pip` is installed in the environment.
2. Install the sensipy using pip.

```bash
conda activate my-environment
conda install pip
pip install sensipy
```

## Testing the installation

To test the installation, you can run the following command:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

This will run the test suite and ensure that the installation is working correctly.

In a conda environment or a virtual environment, you can simply run:

```bash
pytest
```
